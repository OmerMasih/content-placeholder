# Placeholder

This is a simple web application that demonstrates the usage of a placeholder in HTML form fields using CSS and JavaScript.
Installation

No installation is required for this application. Simply clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
Usage

To use the placeholder feature, follow these steps:

    Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
    The web page will load with an input field that has a placeholder text.
    Click inside the input field to activate it.
    As soon as the input field is focused, the placeholder text will disappear.
    Start typing or entering data into the input field.
    If you remove all the entered text and move the focus away from the input field, the placeholder text will reappear.

## Customization

You can customize the placeholder text, its appearance, and behavior by modifying the CSS and JavaScript files.
CSS

The CSS file styles.css contains the styles for the placeholder text. You can modify the following CSS classes to suit your needs:

.placeholder - This class styles the placeholder text itself.
.active - This class is applied to the input field when it is focused, and it hides the placeholder text.

Feel free to update the font, color, size, or any other styles associated with these classes.
JavaScript

The JavaScript file script.js contains the logic to show and hide the placeholder text. If you wish to change the behavior, you can modify the following JavaScript function:

    togglePlaceholder() - This function toggles the visibility of the placeholder text based on the focus state of the input field.

You can update the function's logic or add additional event listeners to achieve different behaviors.
